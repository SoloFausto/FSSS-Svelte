## FSSS User Guide
This quick guide will help you get familiar with how to use this password manager along with the concepts behind it.

### Quick Start guide
1. **Decide a master password:** Pick something that is reasonably secure and you haven't used as a password yet. As this password your sole entry point to generate the other passwords, take good care of it and don't reveal it to anyone or loose it. Failing to do so might mean having to reset your passwords for every account that you have added.
2. **Create your nodes:** Select the root node and create a child node with the name of the platform that you want to use. Being that deleting the parent of a node also deletes all its children, I would reccomend only using the passwords of nodes that don't have any children.
3. **Modify nodes:** Through the side panel you can change a node's label and color to identify them better, or the password generation settings such as allowed characters, length, etc. The "seed" option for each node is an easy way to generate again the password with everything else remaining the same.
4. **Export & Backup:** After you're done making changes to all your nodes, you can either export these nodes as a file or store them in the app's local storage. More importantly, your master password is used to encrypt and decrypt these nodes and is never stored anywhere.
